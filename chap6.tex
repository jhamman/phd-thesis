\chapter {Conclusions}
\label{chap:conclusions}

Overarching ideas motivating my research
  - major changes in the global and arctic climate systems
  - need for better models for prediction
  - need for better models for process understanding

Rational for using coupled RCMs to approach my research questions
  - RCMs off a coupled framework with fewer degrees of freedom
  - computationally less expensive
  - test bed for high-res coupled model development

Advanced understanding from chapter 2
  - introduced a novel coupling of the VIC model within RASM
  - evaluated VIC compared to observations and other models (reanalyses)
  - identified areas where VIC was performing better than other coupled models
  - identified areas where VIC and RASM could be improved

Advanced understanding from chapter 3
  - introduced a new routing model for coupled climate models
  - evaluated the model against in-situ observations
  - identified the sources of biases in the RASM streamflow flux
  - illustrated the impact streamflow has on the coupled ice/ocean system
  - presented a new coastal streamflow dataset for ocean modeling applications

Advanced understanding from chapter 4

Chapters 2 and 3 were model development chapters
  - this dissertation included the development and application of the VIC and RVIC models
  - evaluation of these models required the development of unique methods for comparing datasets derived from observations and models with the goal of understanding and improving the model.
  - while the majority of the ideas that made up the models in chapter 2 and 3 were not new, their application in RASM required extensive effort, both in terms of software infrastructure and model tuning.

Chapter 4 was an application of the model developed in 2/3

Future science opportunities with RASM.
  - RASM development is ongoing.
  - VIC 5
  - higher spatial resolution
  - permafrost
