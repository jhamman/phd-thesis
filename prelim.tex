\acknowledgments{

I would like to thank my academic advisor Dr. Bart Nijssen for his encouragement, support, and guidance.
I am truly thankful for the opportunity to have been a member of his research group.
I would also like to thank the members of my dissertation committee, Dr. Erkan Istanbulluoglu, Dr. Dennis Lettenmaier, Dr. Andrew Roberts, and Dr. Abigail Swann for their insights and encouragement.
Thank you also to the members of the Computational Hydrology Group, it has been a pleasure working alongside all of you.
Much of the research included in this dissertation was made possible by the productive collaboration of the Regional Arctic System Model (RASM) team.
The RASM team was led by Dr. Wieslaw Maslowski (PI), Dr. John Cassano (co-PI), Dr. William Gutowski, Dr. Bart Nijssen (co-PI), and Dr. Andrew Roberts (co-PI).
I am thankful to have been a member of the RASM team and to have had the opportunity to experience such a productive interdisciplinary collaboration.

Thank you to my family for their incredible support throughout my graduate studies - especially to Lauren for her unending encouragement.

My research associated with the RASM project was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Grants DE-FG02-07ER64460 and DE-SC0006856 to the University of Washington.
Supercomputing resources were provided through the Department of Defense (DOD) High Performance Computing Modernization Program at the Army Engineer Research and Development Center and the Air Force Research Laboratory.

At the time of writing, Chapter \ref{chap:rasm} has been published as \citet{Hamman_2016a} in the \textit{Journal of Climate}.
I would like to thank the \textit{Journal of Climate}, published by the American Meteorological Society, for granting the rights to include this article as part of this dissertation.
